Kehne ko toh khel hai yeh tera mera sanjha
As such it's just a game between us
Par mera dil hai patang aur teri nazar manjha
But my heart is a kite, your eyes are the string
Manjhe se lipti yeh patang judi judi jaaye
This kite is totally connected to the string
Udi udi jaye, udi udi jaye
It's flying, it's flying
Dil ki patang dekho udi udi jaye
Look, the kite of the heart is flying
